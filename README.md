# Data_Structures
<p>Data Structures are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently. Data structures have a wide and diverse scope of usage across the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering.</p>
<h3> Programs related to data structures in C++ from my university course.
 Following Data Structures are implemented: </h3>
<li> Binary Tree </li>
<li> Circular Linked List </li>
<li> Double link list </li>
<li> Prioriy Queue </li>
<li> Queue</li>
<li> Stack </li>
<li> Hash tree </li>
<br>

<p> Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their own characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages </p> 
<h3>Binary Tree</h3>
<p>A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent. Every node in a binary tree has a left and right reference along with the data element. The node at the top of the hierarchy of a tree is called the root node.</p>

<h3>Circular Linked List</h3>
<p>The circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. In a circular linked list, the first node and the last node are connected to each other which forms a circle. There is no NULL at the end.</p>

<h3>Double Link List</h3>
<p>Doubly Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which navigation is possible in both ways, either forward and backward easily as compared to Single Linked List./p>

<h3>Priority Queue</h3>
<p>Priority Queue is an abstract data type that is similar to a queue, and every element has some priority value associated with it. The priority of the elements in a priority queue determines the order in which elements are served (i.e., the order in which they are removed).</p>

<h3>Queue</h3>
<p>A queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order. We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.</p>

<h3>Stack</h3>
<p>The stack data structure is a linear data structure that accompanies a principle known as LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). Real-life examples of a stack are a deck of cards, piles of books, piles of money, and many more.</p>

<h3>Hash Tree</h3>
<p>Hash tree is a data structure used for data verification and synchronization. It is a tree data structure where each non-leaf node is a hash of it's child nodes. All the leaf nodes are at the same depth and are as far left as possible.</p>

<h3>  Benefits of data structure </h3> 
<li> Data structure modification is easy.  </li> 
<li> It requires less time.</li> 
<li> Save storage memory space </li> 
<li> Data representation is easy</li>
<li> Easy access to the large database </li><br>
